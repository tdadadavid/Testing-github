oh grass wh hath thou green
Winter comes qickly
And there is no shade for safety oh grass
Nature herself cries at your death 
oh grass if thou had a house thou would be safe
if thou had a cover thy beuty will be preserved 
oh poor grass
thy beuty fadesout like the morning due 
oh green grass oh 
Winter calls winter cries 
Am not willingly doing so to grass 
but my master wind forces me 
I travel long distances that i dont want 
and i cant stop
I feel your pain oh grass i truly feel your pain
