oh grass wh hath thou green
Winter comes qickly
And there is no shade for safety oh grass
Nature herself cries at your death 
oh grass if thou had a house thou would be safe
if thou had a cover thy beuty will be preserved 
oh poor grass
thy beuty fadesout like the morning due 
oh green grass oh
I dont feel sorry for thee oh grass
your drink me up when am forced to flow in your path
by the fierce master the wind
I to go through pain
